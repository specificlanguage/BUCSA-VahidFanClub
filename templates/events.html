        <h2>Hacks & Hangouts</h2>
        <p> Hosted by the CS Ambassadors, Hacks and Hangout sessions are a place where incoming Freshmen and transfer students have the ability to get to know each other outside of the formal Orientation experience. Get to know possible mentors through interactions with upperclassmen in our program. Learn about popular courses and professors, low key beautiful locations in Boston, student preferences on housing and dorm essentials, and tips and tricks on how to get the most out of your BU experience. After answering your questions, get to know your peers through informal conversation, engage with one another through multiplayer games and activities, or even continue the diligent search for a roommate. The Hacks and Hangout sessions are each unique, and will be hosted on the Saturdays after each Orientation session:
